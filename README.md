## Overview

This firmware transforms your Ulanzi TC001 into a self-contained API monitoring device. Perfect for scenarios where you need portable, at-a-glance monitoring without relying on external infrastructure.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This firmware supports up to 5 screens, each displaying a single value from a REST API that returns simple JSON. It is not suitable for APIs that require OAuth, browser-based authentication flows, or complex multi-step requests (e.g. YouTube, Spotify, Google). If you have feature requests or ideas, please use the Discussions area.

**Key Use Cases:**
- Markets: Social media followers
- Trade show booth metrics (visitor counts, lead generation)
- Support ticket monitoring on the go
- Real-time sales dashboards
- IoT sensor data display
- Any REST API with JSON responses

**Why This Over AWTRIX?**
AWTRIX requires an external server to POST data to the device. This firmware polls APIs directly from the device, making it ideal for portable use on public WiFi networks where you can't run external servers.

## What's New in v1.1.4

- **Per-screen color bar** - Optional bottom row (y=7): 24 px beside an 8×8 icon, or 32 px full width without icon. JSON array of exactly 24 HEX colors (`#` optional) or `null` (gray). Configure **Color Bar JSON Path** on each screen (e.g. `numbers`). Empty path = no bar.

## What's New in v1.1.3

- **Per-screen text size** - Compact (TomThumb 3×5, default) or Standard (7 px) is configured per screen on **Edit Screen**, not in General Settings. New screens default to Compact.

## What's New in v1.1.2

- **Compact text size (TomThumb)** - Smaller 3×5 font with correct baseline on the 8 px matrix. Included [`TomThumb.h`](TomThumb.h) from Adafruit GFX (BSD license).

## What's New in v1.1.1

- **API Key Security Fix** - API keys are no longer sent to the browser when editing a screen. The edit form now shows a masked placeholder instead. Leaving the key field blank on save preserves the existing key

- **Polling Stagger Fix** - Non-active screens now have their first poll staggered 15 seconds apart on startup, preventing all screens from polling simultaneously and potentially freezing the web UI for extended periods

## What's New in v1.1.0

- **Multi-Screen Support** - Configure up to 5 independent screens, each with its own API endpoint, JSON path, icon, polling interval, and display settings
- **Button Navigation** - Short press Button 1 (previous) or Button 3 (next) to switch between screens; screen name shown briefly on the LED matrix when switching
- **Auto-Rotation** - Optionally auto-cycle through screens at a configurable interval (3-300 seconds), configurable in General Settings
- **Screen Management Web UI** - New `/screens` page to add, edit, delete, and set active screens with a card-based overview showing live values
- **Independent Polling** - Each screen polls its own API at its own interval, so data is always fresh when switching
- **Backward Compatible** - Existing single-screen configurations are automatically migrated to the new multi-screen format on first boot; backup/restore supports both old and new formats

## What's New in v1.0.8

- **Backup & Restore** - Save and restore your device configuration via the web interface
- **Web Installer** - Implemented easy web installer to load firmware onto devices

## What's New in v1.0.7

- **Password Protection** - All configuration pages are now protected by password authentication. Default password is `ulanzitc001`, configurable in General Settings
- **Session Management** - 30-minute session timeout with automatic refresh on activity
- **Secure Logout** - Logout button added to main page for secure session termination
- **Manual API Refresh** - Press the middle button (Button 2) for 1 second to force an immediate API refresh
- **Improved Button Handling** - Completely redesigned button state machine for cleaner, more scalable button combinations
- **Automatic URL Encoding** - API endpoints are now automatically URL-encoded, so you can paste URLs directly from documentation without manual encoding
- **HTML Form Security** - Fixed HTML escaping to properly handle special characters in configuration fields
- **Test API Timeout** - Added 10-second timeout to Test API function to prevent web UI lockups

## What's New in v1.0.6

- **MAC Address Fix** - Was not properly retrieving MAC address to generate unique device name

## What's New in v1.0.5

- **Interactive Icon Editor** - Added color picker for selecting paint colors, Made icon preview grid clickable to paint individual pixels, Added "Clear All" button to reset icon, Implemented two-way sync between JSON array and visual editor.
- **API Retry Logic** - Added 10 second timeout to API requests, Implemented automatic retry (up to 2 attempts) for network/timeout errors.

## What's New in v1.0.4

- **General Config** - Move display brightness to a general config page.
- **Reboot** - Able to reboot device from config page.
- **Tidy Up** - Tidied up the config screens, removed all the dedicated battery information as it was to much info.

### API Settings

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **API Endpoint URL** | Full URL to your API (query parameters automatically encoded) | `https://api.example.com/data?filter=Name eq 'Value'` |
| **API Header Name** | Authentication header name | `APIKey`, `Authorization`, `X-API-Key` |
| **API Key** | Your API authentication key | `your-secret-key-here` |
| **JSON Path** | Path to value in JSON response | `OverdueWorkflows[Username=John].Overdue` |
| **Display Prefix** | Text before the value (optional) | `Tickets: ` |
| **Display Suffix** | Text after the value (optional) | ` open` |
| **Text Color** | Default (green/red), static color picker, or hex from API via JSON path | `data.color` → `#FF8800` |
| **Icon Data** | 8x8 RGB icon as JSON array (optional) | `[[255,0,0],[0,255,0],...]` |
| **Text Alignment** | Scrolling, or static left / center / right | `scroll` (default), `left`, `center`, `right` |
| **Polling Interval** | Seconds between API calls | `60` (range: 5-3600) |
| **Auto Brightness** | Checkbox for automatic brightness control | Checked = use light sensor, Unchecked = manual |
| **Manual Brightness** | Slider for brightness level (when auto disabled) | `40` (range: 1-255) |
| **Animate Screen Changes** | 1s horizontal slide when switching screens (ease-out-quart) | Off by default; Btn1/Btn3 work during animation to skip; Btn1 = left, Btn3 = right |
| **Auto-Rotate Screens** | Cycle through screens automatically | Optional interval 3-300 seconds |

**Note about URL encoding:** You can paste API URLs directly from your API documentation. Special characters in query parameters (like spaces, quotes, etc.) are automatically URL-encoded when the request is sent. For example, `filter=Name eq 'John'` is automatically encoded to `filter=Name%20eq%20%27John%27`.

#### JSON Path Examples

The firmware supports flexible JSON path navigation with array filtering:

**Simple root level:**
```json
{ "count": 42 }
```
JSON Path: `count`

**Nested object:**
```json
{ "data": { "unassigned": 12 } }
```
JSON Path: `data.unassigned`

**Array access by index:**
```json
{ "results": [{ "value": 99 }] }
```
JSON Path: `results[0].value`

**Array filtering by field value:**
```json
{
  "OverdueWorkflows": [
    { "Username": "John", "Overdue": 5 },
    { "Username": "Jane", "Overdue": 12 }
  ]
}
```
JSON Path: `OverdueWorkflows[Username=Jane].Overdue`

**Complex nested:**
```json
{
  "TC001MatrixDisplay": [
    { "OpenRequests": 12 }
  ]
}
```
JSON Path: `TC001MatrixDisplay[0].OpenRequests`

**Value and color from the same API response:**
```json
{ "count": 12, "color": "#FF8800" }
```
- JSON Path (value): `count`
- Color JSON Path: `color`
- Supported color formats: `#RRGGBB`, `RRGGBB`, `#RGB`, or `r,g,b`

#### Array Filtering Syntax

Use the format `arrayName[fieldName=value]` to filter arrays:
- `users[name=John].age` - Find user with name "John" and get their age
- `products[id=12345].price` - Find product with id "12345" and get price
- `tickets[status=open].count` - Find ticket with status "open" and get count

This searches through the array and returns the first object where the field matches the value.

### Icon Configuration

Icons are 8x8 pixels in RGB format. The JSON array should contain exactly 64 pixel values:

```json
[[255,0,0],[255,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[255,0,0],[255,0,0],
 [255,0,0],[255,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[255,0,0],[255,0,0],
 ...64 total pixels...]
```

Each pixel is `[red, green, blue]` with values 0-255.

The web interface provides a live preview of your icon before saving. Icons scroll alongside the text when alignment is **Scrolling**, or stay fixed on the left when using static alignment modes.

### Text Alignment Modes

**Scrolling (default):**
- Icon and text scroll continuously from right to left
- Ideal for longer text or when you want continuous motion
- Full content visibility over time

**Left / Center / Right:**
- Text stays fixed in the text area (24 pixels wide when an 8×8 icon is shown, full width otherwise)
- **Center** matches the previous “static” checkbox behavior
- If text is wider than the available area, it clips from the right (left and center) or from the left (right)
- Ideal for at-a-glance monitoring with icon + short value

### Brightness Configuration

The TC001 offers two brightness control modes to suit different environments and preferences.

**Auto Brightness Mode (Recommended):**
- Uses the onboard light sensor (GPIO35) to automatically adjust brightness
- Adapts in real-time to ambient lighting conditions
- Brightness ranges:
  - **Very dark** (sensor 0-100): Brightness 1-5 (very dim for nighttime)
  - **Dim room** (sensor 100-500): Brightness 5-30 (low for dark rooms)
  - **Normal indoor** (sensor 500-2000): Brightness 30-120 (comfortable for typical indoor lighting)
  - **Bright light** (sensor 2000-4095): Brightness 120-255 (high for daylight/bright rooms)
- Updates every 100ms for smooth transitions
- Perfect for displays in rooms with varying light throughout the day

**Manual Brightness Mode:**
- Fixed brightness level set via slider (1-255)
- Brightness 1 = barely visible (ideal for very dark rooms)
- Brightness 40-80 = comfortable for normal indoor use
- Brightness 150-255 = very bright (for well-lit areas or outdoor use)
- Useful when consistent brightness is preferred

**Tip:** Start with auto brightness mode and observe the display throughout the day. If you find it too bright or dim at certain times, you can switch to manual mode and set your preferred level.

### Testing API Connection

You must save API configuration before using the **Test Connection** button to verify:
- API endpoint is reachable
- Authentication is working
- JSON path correctly extracts the value
- Response format is as expected

### Battery Monitoring

The TC001 has a built-in LiPo battery that is continuously monitored. The firmware provides comprehensive battery information:

Battery Voltage Ranges
- **4.2V** = 100% (fully charged)
- **3.9V** = ~75% (good)
- **3.7V** = ~40% (moderate)
- **3.5V** = ~15% (low)
- **3.0V** = 0% (empty)

#### Audio Alerts
- **Single beep** = Low battery warning (20%) - plays once per boot
- **Double beep** = Critical battery (10%) - repeats periodically

#### Viewing Battery Status

### Building and Publishing Releases

If you're a developer creating a new release, follow these steps to generate all required binary files for the web installer:

#### 1. Export Compiled Binaries from Arduino IDE

1. Open `Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Configure board settings:
   - **Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino → ESP32 Dev Module**
   - **Tools → Partition Scheme → Default 4MB with spiffs (1.2MB APP/1.5MB SPIFFS)**
3. Go to **Sketch → Export Compiled Binary** (or press Ctrl+Alt+S)
4. Wait for compilation to complete
5. Arduino IDE will create several files in your sketch folder:
   - `Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor.ino.bin` - Main application
   - `Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor.ino.bootloader.bin` - Bootloader
   - `Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor.ino.partitions.bin` - Partition table

#### 2. Get boot_app0.bin

The `boot_app0.bin` file is not exported by Arduino IDE but is required for ESP32 flashing. You can find it in your Arduino ESP32 package:

**Windows:**
```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32\hardware\esp32\<version>\tools\partitions\boot_app0.bin
```

**Mac:**
```
~/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/<version>/tools/partitions/boot_app0.bin
```

**Linux:**
```
~/.arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/<version>/tools/partitions/boot_app0.bin
```

#### 3. Copy Files to Web Installer Folder

Copy and rename the exported files to `docs/firmware/`:

```bash
# Copy main application (rename to customfirmware.bin)
cp Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor.ino.bin docs/firmware/customfirmware.bin

# Copy bootloader
cp Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor.ino.bootloader.bin docs/firmware/bootloader.bin

# Copy partition table
cp Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor.ino.partitions.bin docs/firmware/partitions.bin

# Copy boot_app0.bin from Arduino ESP32 package
cp <path-to-arduino15>/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/<version>/tools/partitions/boot_app0.bin docs/firmware/boot_app0.bin
```

#### 4. Update Version Numbers

Update version numbers in these files:
- `Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor.ino` - Line 12: `String buildNumber = "vX.X.X";`
- `docs/manifest.json` - Line 3: `"version": "X.X.X",`
- `docs/index.html` - Line 7 (title) and line 22 (version display)
- `README.md` - "What's New" section at the top

#### 5. Test the Web Installer Locally

Before pushing to GitHub, test the web installer locally:

1. Start a local web server in the `docs` folder:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Test the installation process with your TC001 device
4. Verify settings are preserved during update

#### 6. Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Release vX.X.X - Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

#### 7. Enable GitHub Pages

If not already enabled:
1. Go to repository **Settings → Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **main** → **/docs** folder
4. Click **Save**

GitHub Pages will be available at: `https://tommysharpnz.github.io/Ulanzi-TC001-API-Monitor/`

#### Binary File Addresses Reference

For manual flashing or troubleshooting:
```
0x1000  (4096)   - bootloader.bin
0x8000  (32768)  - partitions.bin
0xE000  (57344)  - boot_app0.bin
0x10000 (65536)  - customfirmware.bin (main application)
```

The web installer automatically flashes all files at the correct addresses.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:

### High Priority
- [x] Concept of "screens" allowing for multiple API endpoint support with button navigation or auto rotation
- [x] Multiple API endpoints with button navigation

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Threshold-based color coding (e.g., red if value > 10)
- [ ] Time display option
- [ ] Temperature/weather display

### Low Priority
- [ ] OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates
- [ ] Show recent serial log entries in web config UI

## Troubleshooting

### Device Won't Connect to WiFi

**Symptoms:** Device stuck in AP mode or shows "WIFI FAIL"

**Solutions:**
1. Hold Button 1 during startup to manually enter config mode
2. Verify WiFi credentials are correct
3. Check WiFi signal strength
4. Ensure 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)

### API Not Updating

**Symptoms:** Display shows old value or error message

**Solutions:**
1. Use "Test Connection" button in web interface
2. Check API endpoint is accessible from device's network
3. Verify API key is correct and not expired
4. Confirm JSON path matches actual response structure
5. Check Serial Monitor for detailed error messages

### Display Shows Wrong Value

**Symptoms:** Extracted value doesn't match expected data

**Solutions:**
1. Verify JSON path syntax in configuration
2. Use "Test Connection" to see raw API response
3. Check for array indices starting at 0
4. Ensure nested object paths use correct notation
5. For array filtering, verify field names and values match exactly

### Icon Not Displaying

**Symptoms:** Icon doesn't appear or shows incorrectly

**Solutions:**
1. Verify JSON array has exactly 64 pixels
2. Check preview in web interface before saving
3. Ensure each pixel is `[r,g,b]` format with values 0-255
4. Clear icon data field and re-paste if corrupted
5. Check serial monitor for icon parsing errors

### Can't Access Web Interface

**Symptoms:** Can't browse to device's IP address

**Solutions:**
1. Verify device is on same network as your computer/phone
2. Check IP address shown on LED display
3. Try pinging the device: `ping 192.168.x.x`
4. Reboot the device (power cycle)
5. Factory reset and reconfigure if needed

### Serial Monitor Debug

Connect USB and open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to see:
- Startup messages
- WiFi connection status
- Battery voltage and percentage
- API request/response details
- JSON parsing results
- Icon parsing status
- Error messages

## Technical Notes

### Storage
- WiFi credentials stored in ESP32 WiFi NVS
- API settings stored in custom NVS namespace: `tc001`
- Settings persist across firmware updates
- Factory reset clears both WiFi and custom NVS
- Icon data stored as JSON string (max ~512 bytes)

### Battery Monitoring Details
- ADC: 12-bit resolution (0-4095) on GPIO34
- Reference voltage: 3.3V
- Voltage divider: Typically 2:1 ratio
- Update frequency: Every 10 seconds
- Samples per reading: 10 (averaged)
- Non-linear voltage curve for LiPo batteries

### Security Considerations
- API keys stored in plaintext in NVS
- Keys only masked in web UI display
- Use HTTPS endpoints when possible

### Network Requirements
- Requires 2.4GHz WiFi (ESP32 limitation)
- Outbound HTTP/HTTPS connectivity needed
- No incoming connections required
- May not work on networks with captive portals

### Performance
- Typical API response time: 200-500ms
- Display update rate: 50ms per scroll step (scrolling mode)
- Static mode: Updates every 1 second
- Auto brightness: Updates every 100ms
- Battery monitoring: Updates every 10 seconds
- Memory usage: ~150KB RAM with icon loaded

### Brightness Control Details
- Light sensor: 12-bit ADC (0-4095 range) on GPIO35
- Auto mode brightness mapping:
  - Very dark (0-100): Brightness 1-5
  - Dim room (100-500): Brightness 5-30
  - Normal indoor (500-2000): Brightness 30-120
  - Bright light (2000-4095): Brightness 120-255
- Manual mode: Direct brightness control (1-255)
- Brightness settings stored in NVS, persist across reboots
- Updates apply immediately upon saving configuration
